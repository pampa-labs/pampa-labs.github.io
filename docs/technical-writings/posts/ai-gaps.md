# AI’s First Day: Exposing the Gaps

Bringing AI into a company is like hiring a new employee—one that’s demanding, detail-oriented, and can’t rely on intuition. AI, like any new team member, needs everything explained clearly and thoroughly. 

This process often reveals that our knowledge isn’t as well-structured or organized as we thought. The act of integrating AI into our operations forces us to critically assess our existing processes and documentation, uncovering gaps and inefficiencies that have been overlooked for years.

To use AI effectively, companies need standardized processes and comprehensive documentation. Many fall short here, making it challenging to train AI systems or ensure consistent results. AI integration exposes the weaknesses of non-standardized processes that have evolved organically over time without a clear structure. Internal documentation often lacks the necessary rigor because it’s considered “good enough” for internal use—outdated, imprecise, and full of gaps that only certain employees can fill with their personal knowledge. This might work in a human-only environment where employees can adapt and fill in these gaps intuitively, but for AI, imprecision is not an option.
